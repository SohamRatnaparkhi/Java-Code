AND 
    1 False then whole expression is False
    All true then only expression is true
    ** Digit AND 1 always gives the same digit
        use - Check odd even     

OR
    Opposite of AND

XOR
    If bits different then the expression is true else the expression is false
    ** Bit XOR 1 gives the complement of the expression
       BIt XOR 0 gives the same bit

LEFT SHIFT <<
    Shifts bits by number on right side and fills zero at empty places
    ** Number << 1 = 2 * Number 
       a << b = a * (2^b)

RIGHT SHIFT >>
    Removes the last "number" bits from the right side
    ** a >> b == a / (2^b)
